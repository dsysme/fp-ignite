### Case class Summery
* Concise
* Reasonable equals semantics 
* Meanigful toString
* Support for Builder pattern
* Extractor object to

@title[Power and Responsibility]
### Greater Power Greater Responsibility
* More power to do things with functions
* More power to do things with types 
* Responsibility to keep functions pure

@title[More power to functions]
### More power to functions - Examples
* pass as paramter and return as result
* pass by name

@title[We gain laziness]
### We gain laziness
```java
logger.debug(veryExpensiveCall())
```
```java
logger.debug(() -> veryExpensiveCall())
```
```java
public static final Function<String> veryExpensiveCallSupplier = 
  new Supplier<String>() {
    public String get() {
        return veryExpensiveCall();
    }
}; 

// Usage:
if (debugLevel == "debug")
  log(veryExpensiveCallSupplier.get())
```

@title[More power to types]
### More power to work with types - Examples
* apply tools from Category theory
* [build in dependency injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZasXwtTRkio)
* [hd-hoc polymorphism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e9tcymPl7w)
* Safer safe type langauge

@title[Why learn FP?]
### Why Learn functional Programming?
* To gear you mind into becoming a better programmer
* To reuse your code like Lego bricks
* To fully exploit the power of the compiler to guard us from mistakes
* So you can be lazy: do more, do it more efficiently and with far less code 
* So you can have fun!
