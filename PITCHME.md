### Case class Summery
* Concies
* Pragmatic equal sematics 
* Meanigful toString
* Support for Builder pattern
* Support for Pattern extraction

@title[Power and Responsibility]
### Greater Power Greater Responsibility
* More power to do things with functions
* More power to do things with types 
* Responsibility to keep functions pure
---
@title[More power to functions]
### More power to functions 
* pass as paramter and return as result
* pass by name

@title[We gain laziness]
### We gain laziness
```java
logger.debug(veryExpensiveCall())
```
```java
logger.debug(() -> veryExpensiveCall())
```
```java
// Hoisted Function
public static final Function<String> veryExpensiveCallSupplier = 
  new Supplier<String>() {
    public String get() {
        return veryExpensiveCall();
    }
}; 

// Usage:
if (debugLevel == "debug")
  log(veryExpensiveCallSupplier.get())
```

@title[More power to types]
### More power to work with types
* Higher Kinded Type which looks like this ```Monad[T[_]]```
* type classes
---
### We can harness the compiler to help us in new ways
* Safer safe type langauge
* [hd-hoc polymorphism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e9tcymPl7w)
* [build in dependency injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZasXwtTRkio)
